## Creative Coding with p5

### What is creative coding?
Creative coding is the process of using computer programming as a tool for art and design. There is a long history of people using computers to make art dating back as far as the 1950s when Ben Laposky made photographs of patterns he created using an oscilloscope.

### What is p5?
p5 is a library for Javascript that brings the power of [Processing](https://processing.org/) to the web. With basic knowledge of Javascript, p5 makes it easy to get started creating visual and audio experiences in the browser by using the html5 canvas element.

### How to get started:
1. Clone this repo.
2. Open the directory in your text editor of choice.
3. Copy and paste the file path of "index.html" file into your web browser's address bar.
4. Edit your "sketch.js" file and refresh the browser page to view changes.
5. Repeat step 4 until you are satisfied with the results.
